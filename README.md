This repository contains the codes for processing and evaluating the quality of CosMx and Xenium data, used by the paper "Performance differences between spatial platforms identify unique Treg biology contributing to inflammatory bowel diseases".

To analyze CosMx and Xenium multi-tissue data, please follow the steps in [CosMx_MT_vs_Xenium_MT](https://github.com/luoyuanlab/NorthwesternIBDAtlas/tree/main/CosMx_MT_vs_Xenium_MT).

To analyze CosMx 6K, Xenium multi-tissue, colon-specific, and 5K data, please follow the steps in [CosMx_6K_vs_Xenium_different_panels](https://github.com/luoyuanlab/NorthwesternIBDAtlas/tree/main/CosMx_6K_vs_Xenium_different_panels).
